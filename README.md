## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **Framework**: UIKit (programmatic UI)
- **Networking**: URLSession
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **iOS Version**: iOS 14.0+

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable code:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer, including news article structs and API response models.
- **View**: UIKit-based views and view controllers that display the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic, communicates with the network layer, and prepares data for the views using Combine publishers.
